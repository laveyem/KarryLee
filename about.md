Name：NaicenLee
chinese：李可可

NaicenLee is a devoted programming enthusiast who uses code to create the world that belongs to us.

I like to write code, but it's not my profession.

Among the programming languages, I came into contact with assembly language earlier. Later I learned C language and html, and later I learned the web development Wamp of the system.

Html, h5, javascript, thinkphp, css3, mysql, apache, Linux shell, Smarty and related languages and technologies are often used in projects. Oh, it looks very complicated.

Actually, these are not the main reasons why I like to write code. The main reason is to write code to give an example. Writing code is like writing a book or a book. Use it to create our own things and write our own style.

Writing code not only enables me to learn new technologies and knowledge, but also meets many technological masters. It's not just about writing code, it's also about making lots of friends and technology that you've never touched before. Different writing styles and ways make my thinking more open. I am very happy that I can continue to write my code, although I usually do not have much time.

Yes, I think it is.

Code style
```php
<?PHP
Header("Content-type:text/html;charset=utf-8");
    echo "<span style="font-size:10px;">Come on!</span>";

```

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf('helloword！/n');
} 
```
I prefer this style of writing.***Fortran77***，But I can't get everything all done.

```f
C     HELLOWORLD.F
C
      PROFRAM HELLOWORLD
      WRITE(*,10)
   10 FORMAT('HELLO,WORD')
      END PROFRAM HELLOWORLD

```
